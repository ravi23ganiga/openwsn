# Why choose OpenWSN Foundation? #

OpenWSN Foundation = {hardware} + hardware abstraction layer + kernel + components{protocols, auxiliary components, middleware components, etc}

  * fully ANSI C complied, which means it can be easily ported to almost all industry micro-controllers

  * fully components organization. which means: A) the application can be assembled from selected components easily. B) the application can use components required only without considering the complexity of other components.

  * low power software support. this is achieved by the integration of event based architecture and task scheduling based architecture.

  * friendly to developers. the developers needn't to learn a new language. the learning curve is pretty smooth. no extra skills needed except C developing.

  * friendly to developing: which means it can easily integrate existing mature libraries  in the application or be integrated into the application.

  * scalable: from 1K SRAM to 1M memory (mainly 16bit architecture). depends on how many components used.

  * low memory overhead

  * highly customizable thanks to its service component architecture(SCA)

  * reliable for long term running. --- because eliminate the dynamic memory allocation and free in the implementation.

  * easily ported: thanks to its highly strict layer design. and ANSI C complied. it doesn't depend on the portability of GCC like TinyOS

  * Beyond ZigBee: openwsn is designed to support general applications of WSN and future SN research. So it's much broader than zigbee's target. In particularly, if you want develop a proprietary system or choose a platform to support research, then openwsn is an ideal solution.

  * debugging support
  * periodic measurement and sampling, and data processing architecture which is lacked in zigbee

  * in planning features

  * middleware support (timesync, location, data dissemination, etc)
  * network behavior recording
  * 802.15.4 support
  * script engine support

> any methods that can help building the final sensor network application will be considered by openwsn.
