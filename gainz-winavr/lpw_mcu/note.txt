lpw_mcu: low power support of the microcontroller 


for Atmega128L mcu (copied from its datasheet):

six software selectable
power saving modes. The Idle mode stops the CPU while allowing the SRAM,
Timer/Counters, SPI port, and interrupt system to continue functioning. The Power-
down mode saves the register contents but freezes the OscillatorOscillator, disabling all
other chip functions until the next interrupt or Hardware Reset. In Power-save mode, the
asynchronous timer continues to run, allowing the user to maintain a timer base while
the rest of the device is sleeping. The ADC Noise Reduction mode stops the CPU and
all I/O modules except Asynchronous Timer and ADC, to minimize switching noise dur-
ing ADC conversions. In Standby mode, the Crystal/Resonator Oscillator is running
while the rest of the device is sleeping. This allows very fast start-up combined with low
power consumption. In Extended Standby mode, both the main Oscillator and the Asyn-
chronous Timer continue to run.
