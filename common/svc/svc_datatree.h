 * This module implements a tree based data collection multi-hop protocol and service
 * for ad-hoc network. The module mainly includes three parts:
 *	- Tree generation and maintainance based on flooding.
 *	- Request broadcast, multicast(not support now) or unicast
 *  - Response collection. 
 *
 * The tree generation process is almost the same as the svc_flood module.

 *	- revision developing.
 * @modified by zhangwei in 2008.08 
 *  - fully revision including interface modifications. 
 *  - tested by yan-shixing, shi-miaojing.
 * @modified by zhangwei in 2008.11.25
 *	- add sequence id in the DTP header. It's the sequence id in NET layer.
 *    It's different from the sequence id in MAC layer's 802.15.4 MAC frame format.
 *    The sequence id in DTP header is actually an identifier to distinguish 
 *    different request and response packets.
