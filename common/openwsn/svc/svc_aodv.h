This package provides an implementation of a reduced AODV routing protocol. It supports many RFC features, but 
takes into account the reduced capabilities of Wireless Sensor Network platforms operating over TinyOS.

NST-AODV follows in part the main functionality described on HSN TinyAODV implementation. For that reason some of the modules 
have a similar structure as the one used in the implementation mentioned before.
