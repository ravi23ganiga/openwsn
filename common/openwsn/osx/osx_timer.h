 * TiOsxTimer
 * the osx timer is used to drive the evolution of the whole osx kernel by periodically
 * calling the osx_hardevolve() function. it can also be used to drive some inaccurate
 * sampling tasks. if there's no osx timer, then the system can also drive the
 * osx kernel by infinite loop run. refer to the osx_execute() function. the infinite
 * loop run or osx_execute() can be placed into a separate thread of other RTOS.
 *
 * the MCU's hardware timers are usually very powerful. furthermore, they maybe
 * varies from chip suppliers. however, the OS core only needs a relatively simple
 * timer. it should be lightweight and efficient.
 *
 * for some MCU such as the ARM Cortex M3, the MCU core has already provide a
 * hardware SysTimer to help implement a OS core.

 * For developers
 * - TiOsxTimer is actually an timer/ticker interface required by the osx kernel.
 *   Any component providing this interface can be used to drive the osx kernel.
 * - Usually the TiOsxTimer can be implemented based on TiTimerAdapter, TiRtcAdapter,
 *   TiSysTimer or even the TiTimer component. The default is based on TiSysTimer
 *   as the following. System timer is a special timer which is used to drive
 *   the operating systems only.
 * 
 * @todo
 * - low power features can be added to this component in the future.
