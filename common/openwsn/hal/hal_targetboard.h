/* Q: What's the differene between module hal_targetboard and hal_targetinit?
 * R: hal_targetboard provides a set of utility functions to operate the targetboard.
 * While, the hal_targetinit module provides only one function "target_init" which
 * encapsulate the source from target startup to osx kernel startup.
 * 
 * Q: What's the difference between target_startup() in hal_startup module and target_init()
 * function in hal_targetinit module?
 * R: target_startup() is called automatically when the system is powered on. It's called
 * by the hardware and depends on the CPU architecture. For a lot of CPU, the developing 
 * environment has already provides their own startup source code, so the target_startup()
 * is unnecessary.
 *    Function target_init() is usually called as the first function in main() function. 
 * So it's always after target_startup(). This function is often called by osx kernel when
 * the kernel is startup to perform initialization process. If you don't use the osx 
 * kernel in your application, you can simply call target_init() in main() function.
