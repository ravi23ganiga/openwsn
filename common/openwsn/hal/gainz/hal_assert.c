 * @attention
 * Q: why some times the program switch on/off the LED without any expected order?
 * R: 
 *  when assert() failed, all the LED should ON/OFF at the same time. 
* however, if your program enable the interrupts, and you have ON/OFF operations in the 
* interrupts, then you will see this phenomena.
*   as a suggest: you'd better not switch the LED in interrupt service routine unless you 
* know your results.
* @ I have been changed "while" in line 67 with "if " to keep the process going on --Shimiaojing
