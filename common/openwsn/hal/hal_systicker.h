 *  - upgraded the former module hal_systimer as hal_systicker. Now it's the ticker

 * Q: what is TiSysTimer used for?
 * R: support Embedded OS or hardware drived schedulers
 * 
 * Q: why not using a TiTimerAdapter instead of a new TiSysTimer
 * R: the TiSysTimer is usually much simpler than TiTimeAdapter. it doesn't need
 * multi-channel and capture support. a simple TiSysTimer will make the upper layer
 * embedded os more easier to port to other platforms.
 *
 * Q: what's Tick?
 * R: Tick is an time unit. The system timer generates an expire event every tick
