 * Vector Interrupt Controller(VIC) Management. VIC is usually a IO device inside 
 * CPU. It's different from the global interrupt flag inside the CPU's controller unit. 
 *
 * attention in a lot of MCU, there're no Vector Interrupt Controller support 
 * inside them. This module is currently used with ARM CPU only.
 *
 * @attention
 * there's also an interrupt abstraction and management module in OS layer. that 
 * module provides a common multi-interrupt interface for all the MCU/CPUs. while
 * the VIC module here is only an hardware's interface.
