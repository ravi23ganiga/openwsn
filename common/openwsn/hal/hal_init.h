/* Q: what's the difference between boot() or init()?
 * R: the startup process is as the following:
 *      boot => init => osx kernel run
 *
 * hal_boot module deals with the booting process only. then it will call init().
 * and init() will initialize the architecture related configuratioins and finally 
 * pass the CPU control to osx kernel. attention the init() doesn't do all the configuration
 * of the target board.
