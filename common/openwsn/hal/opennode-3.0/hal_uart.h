 * TiUartAdapter object
 * Essentially, this is the software mapping of the UART hardware 
 * 
 * @modified by zhangwei on 2006-07-20
 * modify the prototype of uart_configure()
 * update some comments of the functions.
 *
 * @modified by zhangwei on 2006-08-18
 * add support to RS232 and RS485 by using macros
 * the configure macro CONFIG_UART_RS232 and CONFIG_UART_RS485 should be defined
 * in "configall.h" in the application.
 * 
 * @modified by zhangwei on 20070410
 * revision. format the source file 
 * eliminate led_twinkle() in interrupt disable state. because it may cause data
 * loss in fast communication.
 * 
 * @modified by makun on 20070412
 * correct the error of data loss
 * modified interrupt service routine
