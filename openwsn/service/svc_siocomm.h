 * UART PDU format
 * SIO PDU is the data frame transmitted on the physical UART. 
 * 		[1B SOF][1B Framelength][1B Frame Control][nB PSDU/Payload]{[2 FCS]}
 * SOF means start of frame. The length byte is the data length + control 1 + length 1
 * 
 * SIO PDU is the part after deleting SOF and length byte in UART PDU
 * 		[1B Frame Control][nB PSDU/Payload]
 * 
 * actually, they two share almost the same settings except the first byte SOF.
 * when you adopt frame support, you should check every byte from the framelength 
 * to the end. if the byte equals to SOF, then should insert another SOF to indicate
 * the case.
