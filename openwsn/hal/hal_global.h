// Global Variables used in HAL layer
//
// 	This module is very important in the whole application. It does not only
// declares and initializes all the global objects, but also create the
// relationships between different objects.
// 	In TinyOS and nesC systems, these relationships are constructed by a separate
// Configurator object. As you have seem here, this is not necessary. You should
// understand and adopt the OOP programming model and use it in such conditions.
