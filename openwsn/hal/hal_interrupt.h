/* hal_interrupt
 * Interrupt Hardware Abstraction. This module is used to control the global 
 * interrupt flag in the CPU only.
 *
 * you SHOULD always perfer to use hal_enter_atomic() instead of hal_enable_interrupts()
 * and hal_leave_atomic() instead of hal_disable_interrupts(). the reason is that 
 * hal_leave_atomic() can leave the global interrupt flag unchanged, while the 
 * disable()/enable() pair will leave the flag enabled!!! this is sometimes unwanted!
 *
 * Q: what's the difference between hal_enter_atomic()/hal_leave_atomic() and 
 * hal_enable_interrupts(), hal_disable_interrupts()?
 * R: 
 * hal_enable_interrupts()
 * hal_disable_interrupts()
 * direct control of the global interrupt flag inside CPU. this interrupt flag 
 * is usually a bit in CPU status register. If is was disabled, then CPU cann't
 * response to any external interrupts. These two functions are always effective 
 * no matter there's an RTOS or not.
 * 
 * hal_enter_atomic()
 * hal_leave_atomic()
 * atomic is an source code block that must be executed as a whole without any 
 * interruption. It's quite similar to the "critical section" supported by OS. 
 * however, the implementation of critical section is much more complex than a 
 * simple atomic block, because the critical section is usually related to the 
 * scheduling mechanism of OS. It may need to switch the context of the thread/process
 * while hal_enter_atomic()/hal_leave_atomic() doesn't do so. These two functions
 * are also supported no matter there's a RTOS or not.
 *
 * @attention
 * - when the system started, it should enable_interrupts() before using the following 
 * two atomic functions.
 * - this module should be OS independent. namely, these functions are existed 
 * no matter there's an RTOS or not.
 *
 * @author zhangwei on 2006-07-20
 *	first version.
 * @modified by zhangwei on 2007-07-21
 *  add two functions hal_enter_critical()/hal_leave_critical()
 * @modified by zhangwei on 2008-12-18
 *  remove two functions hal_enter_critical()/hal_leave_critical()
 *  they should be part of the OS layer. maybe os_enter_critical() in the future.
 *  add two functions hal_enter_atomic()/hal_leave_atomic()
