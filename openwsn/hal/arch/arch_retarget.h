 * Q: How do I retarget C++ streamed I/O?
 * R: Applies to: ARM Developer Suite (ADS), RealView Developer Kit (RVDK) for
 * OKI, RealView Developer Kit (RVDK) for ST, RealView Developer Kit for XScale
 * (RVXDK), RealView Development Suite (RVDS)
 *
 * The C++ libraries depend on the C library for target-specific support. There
 * are no target dependencies in the C++ libraries.
 *
 * To retarget your C++ streamed I/O, we recommend that you retarget the ¡°_sys_xxxx¡±
 * driver level functions. These are the functions used by the C and C++ library
 * and are responsible for target specific I/O. The default implementation uses
 * Semihosting to handle I/O on the host machine.
