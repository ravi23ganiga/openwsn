what's libopen?
==============================================================================
openwsn project provide "libopen.dll" for the following purpose:
- simulation. libopen contains a simple network simulation to enable your application developing without real hardware.
- sensor networks developing interface (WSN-API). it's almost the same as the simulting API
- some high level functions. some one may think it should be categorized as middleware
  

For new developers for libopen
==============================================================================
If you are new to "libopen" developing, you should aware that: 

libopen is essentially composed by four separate parts:
  - TOpenNetwork ( related to TOpenRouter, TSioComm, TUart..)
      it's the core of libopen
  - TQueryEngine
      query parser and execution
      it's based on TOpenNetwork interface.
  - TSimuNetwork
      share the same interface with TOpenNetwork
      you can configure the network object to "SIMULATION" mode.
  - TBinaryXml
      a utility help you assemble/disassemble data in payload buffer.
      
you should review the following modules first:
  global.*
  libopen.*
  svc_netnode, svc_network
  svc_queryengine, svc_dataset      
  svc_netsimu
  rtl_binaryxml
  
since we may port "libopen" to embedded device in the future, please use ANSI C/C++
in the developing. considering a lot of embedded devices do NOT support C++ 
developing, i suggest you use C language grammar in this project. you can express
most of your OOP design in C language, i believe.
  
  
history
==============================================================================

make great revision today.
re-designed and re-organized the interfaces. the libopen now has four key objects:
  1. TOpenNetwork(contains TOpenNode, TOpenRouter)   
        (designed, interface done, still needs heavy developing on TOpenRouter
        and packet queuing mechanism)
  2. TQueryEngine( contains TDataSet, TDataItem) (not done, just interface design)
  3. TSimuNetwork( conains TSimuNode)  (simply done, not test)
  4. TBinaryXml (not changed in this revision. not test)

you'll understand the architecture of libopen well if you know these objects and 
their relationships well.


20070515
libopen includes the following objects:
- rs232 communication and configure
- service management (svc_ functions)
- network operations (net_ functions)
- simulation layers (net_ functions)

the old version that can be worked with ZhouSongli's C# worldview and GAINZ
platform is around version 235.


20070205
move four queue operation functions to service/svc_dataqueue.*
add two configuration macros: CONFIG_PALTFORM_ARM and CONFIG_PLATFORM_ATMEL
	in configall.h
add module: hal/hal_openframe.*
add module: service/svc_openpacket.*


2007-01-07
merged with zhousongli's modification. compile passed. 

2006-12-22
modified svc_foundation.h. 
add a lot of definitions, including the macro DLLAPI

modified svcapi.h to export these functions as DLLAPI
