This folder "winavr" is used to keep the testing/demonstration programs developed by winavr. 

Developing envionment is: 

- Windows OS 
- WinAVR + AVRStudio 
or WinAVR + Code::Blocks

We OpenWSN team is using Portable WinAVR and AVRStudio. The projects can be opened directly using AVR Studio and compiled successfully. 

Attention: 
If you found the AVR Studio complains "cannot find file", then you can search for the file and add it directly into the project.
