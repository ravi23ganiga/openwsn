Sniffer Network
=================================================================

A lot of sniffer node can be connected through an wired RS485 network. Each node is a single sniffer device which can listen the frames transmitted near itself, and respond the REQUEST command from the data collection computer and send RESPONSE back.

The logic is:

define nio_rxbuf;
define nio_rxque;
define sio_rxbuf;

while (1)
{
  len = cc2420_recv( nio_rxbuf );
  if (len > 0)
  {
    push the frame inside nio_rxbuf into nio_rxque;
  }
  
  len = uart_recv( sio_rxbuf );  
  if (len > 0)
  {
    if the address of the frame inside sio_rxbuf is the current node
      if the frame inside sio_rxbuf is an DATA_REQUEST
        encapsulate the data inside nio_rxque as an serial communication frame and send it out
      endif
    endif
  }
}
