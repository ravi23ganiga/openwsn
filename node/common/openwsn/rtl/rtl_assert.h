 * 
 * assert support for the runtime library.
 * In the past, the rtl_assert() is support inside rtl_foundation. However, the 
 * assert implementation depends on hal layer modules. In order to break this 
 * dependency, i move the rtl_assert() from rtl_foundation and create this file.
 * 
 * In all the rtl library modules, this module is the only one depends on modules
 * outside of rtl.
