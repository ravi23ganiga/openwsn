 * 
 * assert support for the runtime library.
 * In the past, the rtl_assert() is support inside rtl_foundation. However, the 
 * assert implementation depends on hal layer modules. In order to break this 
 * dependency, i move the rtl_assert() from rtl_foundation and create this file.
 * 
 * In all the rtl library modules, this module is the only one depends on modules
 * outside of rtl.
 * 
 * @modified by zhangwei on 2005-01-20
 *  - released
 * @modified by zhangwei on 200812
 *	- upgraded from the original tk_assert.*
 *	- revision, but not tested
 *	- not tested.
 *	- todo: eliminate the dependence on BCB. it should be ansi/windows only.
 * @modified by zhangwei on 20100713
 *  - fully revised. the rtl_assert() has been moved into rtl_foundation module.
 *    this module is kept for old module's compatible issues.
