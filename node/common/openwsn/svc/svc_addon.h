/**
 * Defines the interface of an application layer addon. An node can accomodate multiple 
 * addons, which is similar to the "profile" in zigbee design. By this way, an node
 * can have different functions. The node secondary developing is mainly the addon 
 * developing because the total application architecture has already been provided
 * by the openwsn system.

 typedef struct{
   void * txque;
   void * rxque;
   TiFunAddonInit( void * txque, void * rxque );
   TiFunAddonEventHandler evolve;
   void * parent;
   void * next;
 }TiAddonInterface;
 
 /* The addon's evolve function is called by the osx kernel or the application framework
  * periodically. And the addon itself only need to respond coming events. For example, 
  * if it got an DATA_READY event, then it can access the front item(request item) 
  * in the rxque to get the item, and push the response item into the txque.
  */
 
 理想情况下，每个addon/component 都应该有自己的txque/rxque
 但是，我们作为high restricted embedded system，只能共享全局的txque/rxque，以最大限度降低memory消耗，或者开辟少数几个que
 
 rxque and txque: stream based 
 
 
 
 process( TNioSession * session )
 session provides two queue for send/recv
