 * svc_wlscomm
 * wlscomm denotes "wireless communication". It bridges the low level wireless adapter
 * and the high level network service/protocol filter. 
 * 
 * It differs from the low level wireless transceiver adapter at:
 *	- Provide high level send()/recv() function and listening mechanism. But all
 *    these are running in non-interrupt mode. So you can freely use them.
 *    While, the TiCc2420Adapter's listener is actually running in interrupt mode.
 *  - contains a simple queue to reduce the frame loss probability. (However, the 
 *    queue isn't mandatory. Furthermore, for the frame based transceiver, the 
 *    frame queue is actually implemented as a I/O filter. So it's unnecessary 
 *    to provide queues inside "wlscomm"
 *
 * The the architecture of a wireless communication application is as the following:
 * 
 *     [application / filter chain iohandler]
 *                      |
 *  [filter_chain: includes protocol and service filters]
 *                      |
 *                  [wlscomm]
 *                      |
 *             [transceiver adapter]
 * 
 * For more about the filter architecture design, please refer to Apache MINA:
 *	- http://mina.apache.org/
 *  - http://mina.apache.org/conferences.data/Mina_in_real_life_ASEU-2009.pdf
 * 
 * The architecture of MINA is:
 *	Remote Peer ~~~ IoService -- IoFilterChain{IoFilters} -- IoHandler
 *  IoService := [IoAcceptor + IoProcessor] | [IoConnector]
 * 
 * The "wlscomm" module in "openwsn" is similar to the "ioservice" in Apache MINA. 
 * However, considering the special features of wireless communication and sensor
 * networks, we simplified MINA's architecture by eliminating the processor part.
