 * [SVC Header] := [SVC Header Length 1B] [SVC Command 1B]

 * 
 * [SVC Command Byte]
 * [b7  b6  b5  b4  b3  b2  b1  b0]
 *
 * [APP Header] := [APP Command 1B]
 * the APP Header only occupy 1 byte. 
 * the length of [APP Header][APP DATA] is calculated as:
 *		PHY frame length - MAC Header size - SVC Header size
 * 
 * [SVC Command Byte]
 * [b7  b6  b5  b4  b3  b2  b1  b0]
 *
 * if b7 == 1, then this is an application layer command. and it can be recognized
 * by the node software, which will lead to some special operations. 
 * if b7 == 0, then this is a pure data frame.
