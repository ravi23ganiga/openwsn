 * Scheduler service
 * 
 * scheduler is an very important service in the system. when you want to do 
 * something immediatly, you can call their function directly. but when you want 
 * to do something in the future or do it periodically such as a sampling task, 
 * you can tell scheduler to do so. furthermore, the scheduler also decides the 
 * best chance to sleep and wakeup in order to save energy.
 *
 * the scheduler can be droven by the periodical timer interrupt, or by a infinit
 * loop call to the evolve() function.
 * 
 * different to the timer object, the scheduler adopts milli-seconds as its basic
 * time unit which is CPU and hardware-independent. 
 *
 * In most cases, one scheduler service is enough in the system. and it will be
 * the most efficient. but this module is still designed to support multi-schedulers.
 * and the evolve() function in one scheduler can be the task of another scheduler.
