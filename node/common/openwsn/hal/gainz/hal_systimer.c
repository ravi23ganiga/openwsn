/* Q: Actually, we can use TiTimerAdapter directly intead of TiSysTimer. Why still
 * introducing a separate TiSysTimer?
 * R: Yes, it's true that TiTimerAdapter can fully replace TiSysTimer. and TiTimerAdapter
 * is more powerful than TiSysTimer. 
 *	However, there's the following benefit to introduce a separate TiSysTimer:
 *	- TiSysTimer is a self-contained module. which means it's easy to port the 
 *    TiSysTimer and the upper osx layer to other platforms. While, porting the 
 *    TiTimerAdapter is more complicated.
 *  - Simple means robust and high performance. This's also true for TiSysTimer.
 *  The disadvantage is:
 *	- you must attention not to affect the configurations of other timers in the TiSysTimer.
