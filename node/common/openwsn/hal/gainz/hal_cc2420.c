 * hal_cc2420.c
 * This module implements a cc2420 adapter service. It's an simple wrapper of the
 * cc2420 low power wireless transceiver from Chipcon/TI. It helps to implement 
 * the MAC network layer. 
 *
 * You can regard the adapter as the PHY layer in layered communication architecture.
 * However. cc2420 provides more functions than a simple PHY.

 *
 * @modified by openwsn on 20110405
 *  - add cc2420_broadcast()

 * 	- upgrade cc2420_ischannelclear()
 *
 * @modified by openwsn on 20110410
 *  - Upgrade cc2420_send and revised the ACK frame processing. Now the cc2420

 * 
 * @attention
 * - According to the description of cc2420 datasheet, the CCA pin is only
 * valid when the receiver has been enabled for at least 8 symbol periods. each symbol
 * periods is about 125us. So when you switch the transceiver mode from TX to RX, 
 * you should wait for at lease 125 us to wait for the CCA pin output correct value.
 *   It's the callers responsibility. So we don't implement the delay inside this
 * function. You can implement the delay by calling:
 *   hal_delayus( 125 )
 * Suggest use hal_delayus(150) instead of hal_delayus(125) because the delay is
 * not accurate.
 * 
 * - Before you use this function, you should enable the transceiver's CCA functionality
 * correctly. You should operate the following registers of cc2420:
 * 
 *   IOCFG0 register (address 0x1C): Controls the polority of CCA pin. (IOCFG0.CCA_POLARITY)
 * 
 *   RSSI.CCA_THR: The threshold value. Can be programmed in steps of 1 dB. The 
 * 		typical value is -77 for cc2420. 
 * 
 * 		ps: Jiang Ridong: suggest to set the value to -50. Attention the settins
 *		shouldn't exceed the transmitting power.
 * 
 *   MDMCTRL0.CCA_HYST: A CCA hysteresis can also be programmed in the MDMCTRL0.CCA_HYST control bits. 
 * 
 *   MDMCTRL0.CCA_MODE: select the CCA mode. Since the cc2420 is an 802.15.4 compatible 
 *      chip, we use choice 2 (clear channel when not receiving valid IEEE 802.15.4 data).
 *      A more strongly choice is 1(clear channel when received energy is below threshold)
 * 
 *   The above initialization process is usually done when the chip is firstly started
 * (usually in function cc2420_open(). In the current implementation, it should be 
 * placed into _cc2420_setreg() ).

/* @attention 
 * refer to cc2420 datasheet page 31
 *
 * - FIFO pin indicates whether there's data in the RXFIFO. and FIFO goes to low
 * when RXFIFO is empty. so you can also judge whether there's data pending in the 
 * RXFIFO by FIFO pin value.  
 *
 * @attention: the FIFOP interrupt is triggered by up edge at cc2420's FIFOP pin
 *	(connect to atmega128's INT6 PIN in GAINZ). you should configure the PIN 
 *  direction and interrupt features during initialization (down edge currently).
 *
 * - The FIFOP pin is high when the number of unread bytes in the RXFIFO exceeds 
 *   the threshold programmed into IOCFG0.FIFOP_THR
 *
 * - when address recognition is enabled the FIFOP will not go high until the 
 *   incoming frame passes address recognition. even if the number of bytes inRXFIFO 
 *   exceeds the programmed threshold
 *
 *	 => how should the interrupt handler do in this case? 
 *      it seems the cc2420 will clear the data in the RXFIFO if address recognition
 *      enabled and recognition failed. if then the interrupt handler needn't do 
 *      any thing. but how about the address recognition disabled?
 *
 * - FIFOP pin will also go high when the last byte of a new packet is received 
 *   even if the threshold is not exceeded. If so  the FIFOP  pin  will go back 
 *   to low once one byte has been read out of the RXFIFO. 
 * 
 *    => summary: FIFOP goes to high when the received bytes in RXFIFO exceed the 
 *       threshold or the whole frame is complete, no matter the address recognition
 *       is enabled or not.
 *    => FIFOP goes to low once one byte has been read out of the RXFIFO.
 *
 * - When address recognition is enabled, data should not be read out of the RXFIFO 
 *   before the address is completely received, since  the frame may be automatically 
 *   flushed by CC2420 if it fails  address recognition. This may be handled by 
 *   using the FIFOP pin, since this pin does not go high until the frame  passes  
 *   address recognition. 
 *
 * Q: what will be if a frame pending inisde cc2420? (???)
 * R: when the first frame arrives, both the FIFOP and FIFO go to high and the 
 *	FIFOP interrupt notify the MCU to process it. 
 *	  assume the MCU hasn't process the FIFOP interrupt in time, the frame will 
 *  be kept inside cc2420's RXFIFO and the second frame arrives now. then overflow 
 *  occurs and the FIFO pin goes to low. at this time, the FIFOP is still high
 *  so the interrupt still has chance to be executes. 
 * 
 *    attention the FIFOP interrupt will not raised to MCU because it's already 
 *  high in the overflow case. there's no chance to change from low to high (we
 *  use the up edge interrupt now).
 * 
 *    suggested processing: if overflow occurs, then you can still read the first 
 *  frame out. then the ISR should be:
 *    1) read first frame out. 
 *    2) check if overflow occurs. if true, then clear the RXFIFO
 *
 * @modified by zhangwei on 20090809

		// will overwrite last frame inside the rxbuf. 
		// I assume the new incoming frame always has the high priority than the elder one.
