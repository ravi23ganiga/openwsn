 * Delay Functions:
 *
 * _cpu_pause()
 * not recommended to use directly.
 * make the program pause for a short time. we don't recomment you use this function
 * directly because the pause duration is determined by CPU and hardware. it's different
 * on different hardware platform. for current implmentation on ARM7 processor,
 * it's about 2 cycle @todo really ???
 *
 * cpu_delay( msec )
 * recommend to use comparing to _hal_pause(). the "delay" parameter is based on 
 * millseconds. for example, if you want to delay 10 millisecond, you can simply call:
 *     hal_delay( 10 );
 *
 * @attention:
 * before using this function, you should configure the following two macros to
 * adapter to you own hardware platform:
 *
 * #define CONFIG_CPU_CLOCK_MSEC_RATIO1 255
 * #define CONFIG_CPU_CLOCK_MSEC_RATIO2 16
 * 
 * the product of these two macros defines how many clock cycle equals to 1 milli-second.
