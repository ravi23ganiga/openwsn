 * External Event Monitor
 * 
 * this module is used to monitor the external hardware event. this is related 
 * to the power mode of the MCU. ideally, the MCU should run in sleep mode or 
 * even power down mode until an external hardware event(usually the interrupt)
 * wakes it. when it wakes up, it may need to do some necessary processing to 
 * recover its state. you can do it in this module.
 * 
 * usually, the monitor's handler is default interrupt handler of all interrupts.
 * then you can do some common processing in monitor's handler and then dispatch
 * the interrupt requests to each interrupt handler.
 * 
 * usually there's only 1 handler monitor handler in the system. however, this
 * module doesn't restrict you to have only 1.
 * 
 * the above features quite appropriate for NIOS II and PIC MCU, because the 
 * hardware only support 1 interrupt handler. while, for ATMEGA and ARM, the 
 * hardware support multiple interrupts. for these MCU, you can still share 
 * the same interrupt handler or let each hardware owns their own interrupt handler.
 * 
 * @attention
 * this module is high hardware related! you should modify it if you want to 
 * port to other platforms!
