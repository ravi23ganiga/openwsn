 * TiSpiAdapter
 *
 * @modified by zhangwei on 20061010
 * based on Huanghuan's mature code.
 * support multiple SPI channel.
 *
 * @modified by zhangwei on 20070509
 * add two function spi_open() and spi_close()
 * these two functions can be used to adjust detail timing when transmitting
 * multi-byte streams. when you want to transmit multi-byte stream, you must
 * call open() and close(). for single byte transmission, also recommend call
 * to open() and close().
 *
 * when you call open() a spi, the code will also select the device.
